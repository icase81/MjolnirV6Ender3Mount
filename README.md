# MjolnirV6Ender3Mount
Mount for Ender 3/clones for an E3D V6 hotend and Mjolnir Extruder

Planning on using an E3D V6 hotend with a <a href="https://github.com/RoyBerntsenDesign/MJOLNIR-Extruder/">Mjolnir Extruder</a> by Roy Bernsten Design and an LDO NEMA14 round
stepper with the 10 tooth pinion gear for approximately 5:1 gear ratio. I was looking for the most compact way to mount one to the other, and this is what I came up with. The
mount itself is a remix of the base from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4689550">here</a>.
